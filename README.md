# Calendar App

This project is a calendar application developed as part of a Udemy course. The front-end of the application was built using the ReactJS framework with Redux for state management. The back-end was implemented with Node.js and the Express.js framework. The application allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on events, which are stored in a MongoDB database. The goal of this project was to learn and apply various technologies such as ReactJS, Redux, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, while building a practical and functional calendar application.
